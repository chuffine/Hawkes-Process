#Hawkes-Process
MATLAB project to fit a Hawkes process using MLE. This was completed for Buttercoin, a Bitcoin exchange startup.

This is a short but powerful script written during my masters to fit a univariate Hawkes process.

A brief explanation of the underlying theory - http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HawkesProcess.html
